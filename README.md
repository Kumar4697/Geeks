Blogging application project
The blog application contains The API which were returned on the JSON-encoded objects (Content-Type: application/json).and the responses vary according to the method/endpoint used, but every response envelope includes these common parts i.e. meta and response.
We used to several functions i.e post and get All Posts we used them because the posts object in getAllPosts is a dictionary that contains much more than just each post from the staff blog - it also has items like how many posts the blog contains, the blog's description and when it was last updated, etc.
I Used the AWS Elastic Beanstalk which configured to allow remote debugging, enabled us to debug their applications directly in the AWS cloud.
Used the subclass functionality that is django.db ,models.Models  , In which each attribute represents a database field. Through this we can automatically have the access to everything within and can add additional fields and methods as desired.
Used the (m venv myenv) which used to create a brand-new virtual environment which doesnâ€™t have any Python package or module from our existing global python installation you can verify it by navigating into the site package directory of the environment as follows.
We have faced the difficulties with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) error which raise to us when we were building tools that help customers to streamline their video workflows with blogs, I resolved it by using AWS Elemental.
